# Canvas Relative Dashboard Tabs

At the beginning of a semester, I often find myself wanting to open all of my canvas courses in separate tabs and work through some tweak (e.g. updating the navigation lists, etc.).

To use the extension in chrome or edge:

## Installation

1. Go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Turn on "Developer mode" (the toggle switch is in the top right of the page for chrome and left navigation for edge).
3. Click the "Load unpacked" button and select this project folder
4. Log into canvas if you haven't yet (this just makes it so that you won't have to log in when you run the extension).

## Usage
After installing, find your extension ID at `chrome://extensions/` (or `edge://extensions/` for Edge), then create bookmarks like the following:
- Course Home Pages: `chrome-extension://YOUR-EXTENSION-ID/canvas-relative.html`
- Attendance Page: `chrome-extension://YOUR-EXTENSION-ID/canvas-relative.html?url=/external_tools/3809`
