# Canvas Relative Dashboard Tabs

At the beginning of a semester, I often find myself wanting to open all of my canvas courses in separate tabs and work through some tweak (e.g. updating the navigation lists, etc.).

## Installation

1. Go to `chrome://extensions` (or `edge://extensions` for Edge)
2. Turn on "Developer mode" (toggle switch in the top right for Chrome, left navigation for Edge)
3. Click the "Load unpacked" button and select this project folder

## Usage

Click the extension icon in your browser toolbar, then click one of the links to open all your course pages.

You can also drag the links to your bookmarks bar for quick access later.

## What It Does

When you click a link, the extension will:
1. Open a new window with the Canvas dashboard
2. Wait for course links to appear
3. Open each course in a separate tab
4. Navigate to the specified page (or home page if none specified)
5. Set the tab title to "Course Name - Page Name" for easy identification
